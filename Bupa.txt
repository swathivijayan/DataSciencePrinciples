Since joining Bupa in July, I have taken great pride in the contributions I’ve made and the progress I’ve achieved within the team. Here’s a summary of my key accomplishments:

Report Creation and Stakeholder Collaboration:
I successfully created four detailed reports, collaborating with key stakeholders such as Jordan, Dave, Simon, and Lisa. This process not only strengthened my reporting skills but also gave me valuable insight into the diverse functionalities and priorities across different sections of the team.

Ad Hoc Requests and Problem Solving:
I managed and responded to numerous ad hoc requests, particularly those from the Controls team. Additionally, I addressed a significant volume of requests through the NSR TPD Insight and Exec mailbox, ensuring timely and accurate responses that supported ongoing operations.

BAU Reporting Support:
During Michelle’s absence due to vacation and illness, I took on the responsibility of managing the BAU reports she typically handled. I am now confident in producing all the BAU reports that Michelle managed, as well as most of the reports handled by Thanos. This seamless transition ensured that the team’s reporting operations continued without disruption.

Survey Tool Research for Broker Questionnaire:
I was entrusted with conducting research on survey tools for the broker questionnaire. This task required me to connect with various providers, understand their offerings, and explain our requirements clearly. By narrowing down the options to a single provider currently undergoing due diligence checks, I contributed to an initiative that involved collaboration across multiple teams and external organisations.

Overall, my work has allowed me to develop a stronger understanding of the team’s operations and build valuable relationships with internal and external stakeholders. It has also enhanced my ability to adapt to new challenges, manage responsibilities effectively, and deliver high-quality results under varying circumstances.

Where you think you could have done things differently/lessons learned


Here’s how you can approach your lessons learned and areas where you could have done things differently:

While I am proud of my achievements since joining Bupa, reflecting on the past months has given me valuable insights into areas where I could improve or approach things differently:

Time Management and Prioritisation:
Managing ad hoc requests alongside regular BAU tasks sometimes stretched my capacity, particularly when multiple urgent items came through simultaneously. I’ve realised the importance of prioritising tasks more strategically and communicating realistic timelines to stakeholders when necessary.

Stakeholder Communication:
While collaborating with stakeholders like Jordan, Dave, Simon, and Lisa has been enriching, I’ve identified instances where I could have engaged earlier or clarified requirements more thoroughly to avoid rework. This has taught me the value of proactive communication and setting clear expectations from the start.

Broader Team Awareness:
Initially, I focused heavily on my immediate responsibilities, but over time, I’ve recognised the importance of understanding the broader organisational goals and how my work contributes to them. This is an area I aim to work on by engaging more with wider team activities and initiatives.

Research on Survey Tools:
While the broker questionnaire research was a great learning experience, I feel I could have streamlined the process by defining more precise evaluation criteria at the outset. This would have made provider comparisons and final decision-making more efficient.

Continuous Learning:
Although I’ve made significant progress in picking up BAU reports and other tasks, I see room to deepen my technical skills further, particularly in advanced reporting tools or data analysis techniques, which could enhance the value I bring to the team.

Here’s a well-rounded approach to your personal objectives for 2025:

Personal Objectives for 2025
Deepen Technical Expertise:
I aim to enhance my technical skills in reporting and data analysis, focusing on advanced tools like Power BI, SQL, and automation techniques. This will help me deliver more insightful and efficient outputs for the team.

Strengthen Stakeholder Relationships:
Building on my collaboration experience, I plan to foster even stronger relationships with key stakeholders. This includes proactively engaging with them to understand their evolving needs and identifying opportunities to add value through my work.

Enhance Time Management and Prioritisation:
To ensure consistent delivery on both BAU and ad hoc tasks, I will work on improving my time management strategies. This includes better prioritisation of tasks, setting clear boundaries, and using tools to stay organised.

Contribute to Process Improvements:
I want to identify and implement improvements in existing processes, particularly in BAU reporting workflows. This could involve automating repetitive tasks or refining report formats to make them more user-friendly and actionable.

Broader Organisational Impact:
I aim to deepen my understanding of the organisation’s strategic goals and align my work more closely with them. Participating in cross-functional initiatives or projects will help me see the bigger picture and make more meaningful contributions.

Develop Leadership Skills:
I’d like to explore opportunities to mentor or support newer team members or take the lead on smaller projects. This will help me build confidence in leadership and management while contributing to the team’s overall success.

Personal Development:
Alongside professional growth, I will focus on improving my communication and presentation skills. This includes articulating my ideas clearly during meetings and producing compelling reports or summaries that resonate with diverse audiences.

Deliver the Broker Questionnaire Project:
Completing the broker questionnaire initiative and ensuring its successful implementation will be a major goal for the first half of the year, as it involves collaboration with external providers and internal teams.
